<h1>Filth</h1>
<br>
<img class="enm" src="./enemies/FilthICO.jpeg" alt="">
<p>Filth are the most basic enemy in the game, as their name sugests, they're very frail and usually any weapon is efficient at killing them, but they can easily overwhelm V1 if he doesn't take them out quickly enough.</p>
<br>
<h1>Stray</h1>
<br>
<img class="enm" src="./enemies/Tall_Husk.jpeg" alt="">
<p>Strays are the second most basic enemy in the game, they don't run at you like Filth do, they launch projectiles from a far, very predictable, but just like Filth, they can overwhelm the player.</p>
<br>
<h1>Schism</h1>
<br>
<img class="enm" src="./enemies/Schism_icon.jpeg" alt="">
<p>The Schism is pretty similar to the Strays, but they're more resilient, and instead of firing a single projectile, they fire in bursts, and it's harder to hit "headshots" cause their head is literally on their shoulders.</p>
<h1>Malicious Face</h1>
<br>
<img class="enm" src="./enemies/Malicious_Face.jpeg" alt="">
<p>The Malicious Face is the first mini-boss of the game, and turns into a common enemy in later stages of the game, they fire several parriable projectiles and can charge up a beam that when fired, will cause an explosion on the location of the player.</p>
<br>
<h1>Swordsmachine</h1>
<br>
<img class="enm" src="./enemies/SwordsmachineICO.jpeg" alt="">
<br>
<p>The Swordsmachine is ULTRAKILL'S first actual boss in the game, their first fase use a selection of attack involving melee attacks and shotgun blasts, when you clear their first healthbar, they run away and drop their shotgun for the player to use, only to come back later in the stage, enraged and only using melee attacks, they are the first skill test for new players.</p>
<br>
<h1>Cerberus</h1>
<br>
<img class="enm" src="./enemies/Cerberus.jpeg" alt="">
<br>
<p>The Cerberus is the final boss of the Prelude act, and serves as a true skill check for the player, making them use all of the skills they have learned on this act, they have some very predictable attacks, but it can overwhelm you, they get turned into common enemies later in the game.</p>
<h1>Drones</h1>
<br><img class="enm" src="./enemies/Drone.jpeg" alt="">
<br>
<p>They are introduced in Act 1, the first enemies you find in the Limbo layer, they may be tricky at first, but you'll soon notice they have very easy patterns, they fly and move around quite quickly, but they only take 2 revolver shots to die, and explode on death, so they can be very useful for horde clearing.</p>
<br>
<h1>Street Cleaners</h1>
<br>
<img class="enm" src="./enemies/Streetcleaner_icon.jpeg" alt="">
<p>Street Cleaners are humanoid robots carrying flamethrowers, which melts V1's healthbar very quickly if you're not careful, but they can be very easily taken out with a charged shot from the Piercer revolver, or deflected bullets from the Marksman Revolver. </p>
<br>
<h1>Hideous Mass</h1>
<br>
<img class="enm" src="./enemies/Hideous_Mass.jpeg" alt="">
<br>
<p>Hideous Mass is one of the bosses on the Limbo layer, it can produce massive shockwaves and launch mortars at the player, dealing tons of damage, keeping the player on the move the entire fight, it has a harpoon attack that severely limits the players abilty to move and dodge attacks, but to compensate for the massive size and firepower the creature has, it also has a massive weakspot in it's belly. </p>
<br>
<h1>V2</h1>
<br>
<img class="enm" src="./enemies/V2Icon.jpeg" alt="">
<br>
<p>V2 is quite literally V1's counterpart, supposedly built after humanity achieved "The New Peace", meaning the robots no longer had a need for blood fueling, so to compensate, they gave him sturdier armor instead of blood refueling armor, V2 acts as the ultimate skill check for the player so far, having the exact same move-set and using the same revolver and shotgun the player uses, knowing how to move and deal damage is required if the player wishes to win.  </p>
<p>When defeated, V2 drops the Knuckleblaster arm, an alternative to V1's default arm, the Feedbacker, and runs away, to one day face V1 again.</p>
<br>
<h1>Soldier</h1>
<br>
<img class="enm" src="./enemies/Shotgun_Husk.jpeg" alt="">
<br>
<p>The soldiers are the first new enemy found in the Lust layer, they are augmented versions of the Stray demons, they are sturdier and more agressive, they can fire multiple projectiles from their arm, like a shotgun, they are still very easy to kill, but they pose more of a challenge to the player.</p>
<br>
<h1>Mindflayer</h1>
<br>
<img class="enm" src="./enemies/MindflayerICO.jpeg" alt="">
<br>
<p>Mindflayers are one of the most sturdier enemies you'll find that aren't considered bosses, they can teleport, launch several heavy-damage projectiles, fire a massive laser beam that does tons of damage and on top of all that, have a lot of health, they are to be taken as priority when facing a lot of enemies.</p>
<br>
<h1>Corpse of King Minos</h1>
<br>
<img class="enm" src="./enemies/MinosCorpseIcon.jpeg" alt="">
<br>
<p>The corpse of King Minos, the once noble and just ruler of the Lust layer, now reduced to a shambling gargantuan corpse, killed by Archangel Gabriel, the final boss of the Lust layer, being the biggest enemy you have faced so far, has a variety of attacks, a giant flying orb that reduces your HP to 1 and leaves you unnable to heal for several seconds, and punches, which can be PARRIED for massive damage to his health bar.  </p>
<p>When his health bar gets reduced to half, giant maggots pop out of his eyes and shoot several hight-damage orbs at you, this boss requires you to know how to dodge, or parry his attacks if you're feeling cocky.</p>
<br>
<h1>Archangel Gabriel, Judge of Hell</h1>
<br>
<img class="enm" src="./enemies/GabrielIcon.jpeg" alt="">
<br>
<p>The current final boss of ULTRAKILL, the Archangel that took The Great King Minos down on the hell uprising, if V2 was a fight where both parties we're evenly matched, this is a fight where you feel like you're actually against one of God's greatest angels, he can fly, teleport, launch light spears and swords which explode on impact, this is the ultimate skill test for now, and requires the average player 30+ retries to defeat him.</p>
<p>When you defeat him, Gabriel gets very irritated, wondering how one of God's greatest angels got defeated by a "mere" machine, he then proceeds to call V1 an "INSIGNIFICANT FUCK", saying the fight is not over, running back home.</p>
<p>When he gets back to heaven on the Angel's council, they scold him for merely suggesting an insignifcant machine could best an angel, saying he has 24 hours to defeat V1 before the "Father's light" leaves his body.</p>
<br>
<h1>Secret Bosses.</h1>
<br>
<h1>Flesh Prison</h1>
<br>
<img class="enm" src="./enemies/FleshPrisonIcon.jpeg" alt="">
<br>
<p>The Flesh Prison is found in the secret layer of P-1, access requires the player to get a P rank on all levels of Act 1, A large octahedron suspended in place by two tendrils. The sides are made of pale skin with flesh underneath, some of them even feature stitches or eyes. Additionally, one of the corners is replaced by an occasionally opening mouth, producing a crooked smile.</p>
<p>This boss is an defensive power-house, summoning drones it can use to heal itself, firing tons of projectiles in a circular pattern, which follow the player around, it can summon holy light attacks, making pillars of light that explode and constantly deal damage to the player. </p>
<p>The best strategy for this fight is taking out the drones first, then dumping tons of damage on the Prison, repeat until this disgusting thing is dead.</p>
<p>When killed, it frees what it was keeping inside the prison, the once great ruler of the Lust Layer, the Prime Soul of...</p>
<br>
<h1>Minos Prime</h1>
<br>
<img class="enm" src="./enemies/MinosPrimeIcon.jpeg" alt="">
<br>
<p>This is the soul of the once great ruler of the lust layer, King Minos himself, locked inside the Flesh Prison's inescapable nightmare after Gabriel struck him down.</p>
<p>When freed, Minos' thanks V1 from freeing him from the flesh prison, saying Gabriel's reckoning is coming, but ultimately, Minos' says the crimes the machines comitted against mankind are unforgivable, and "Thy punishment, IS DEATH"</p>
<p>It is pretty funny the game considered P ranking every stage would be enough for you to take on Minos Prime, words cannot describe how hard this fight actually is, it's almost like a fight game character got put into a movement FPS</p>
<p>Don't be down if you think this boss is too hard, it takes the average player about 100-200+ retries to defeat him, this is a fight of trial-and-error. One advice I can give you is: STAY. ON. THE. GROUND. Minos juggles you in the air a lot, try to stay on the ground to cancel his combos.</p>
