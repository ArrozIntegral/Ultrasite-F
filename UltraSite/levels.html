<h1>Act 0-Prelude</h1>
<br>
<img class="lv" src="./img/0-1_Into_The_Fire.jpeg" alt="">
<p>Prelude mainly serves as a tutorial for ULTRAKILL, introducing basic concepts such as dodging, aiming and managing the style meter, it introduces very "simple" weapons to use, which may lead you to think the game is easy, but I can assure you, you're dead wrong.</p>
<br>
<h1>Act 1-Infinite Hyperdeath</h1>
<br>
<h2>Layer 1-Limbo</h2>
<br>
<img class="lv" src="./img/1-1_Heart_Of_The_Sunrise.jpeg" alt="">
<p>At first, Limbo may seem very different from what you experienced so far, seeming like a peaceful and safe, but noticing that something about this place is very off, and you'd be right about that feeling, the peace and serenity of that place is merely an illusion, and soon demons start appearing again. This level Introduces the Nailgun and some new enemy types, stepping up the difficulty of the game. </p>
<br>
<h2>Layer 2-Lust</h2>
<br>
<img class="lv" src="./img/2-1_Bridgeburner.jpeg" alt="">
<br>
<p>The lust layer kind of returns to the style you saw on the Prelude act, steel corridors and off-putting ambience, but it takes on a more vertical approach, with lots of it's stages having jump-pads and tall buildings, it also introduces the Railcannon, which makes a very big difference in gameplay.</p>
<br>
<h2>Layer-3 Gluttony</h2>
<br>
<img class="lv" src="./img/3-1_Belly_of_the_Beast.jpeg" alt="">
<br>
<p>After defeating The Corpse of King Minos, it falls on the ground with it's mouth open, and you make your way inside. Gluttony may be the most off-putting layer you have experienced so far, with tons of surreal set-pieces and the most brutal enemy line-up you've faced so far, no new weapons are introduced in this layer, mostly because the developers want you to master the mechanics they have introduced so far, and you're really going to need it, cause the final boss fight of this Act may demand that skill of you.</p>

<h1>Act 2- Imperfect Hatred</h1>
<br>
<img class="lv" src="./img/Under_Construction_Warning_Sign_PNG_Clipart-839.png" alt="">
<p>Act 2 is still being worked on by the game's developers, they plan to release it around this winter.</p>
