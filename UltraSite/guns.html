        <h1>V1</h1>
        <br>
        <img class="weps" src="./img/V1-m.jpeg" alt="">
        <p>V1 is a Supreme Machine and the protagonist and player character of ULTRAKILL.
            V1 is the first version of V model, an earlier prototype that came before V2. It specializes in quick
            repairs, using an experimental armor plating that can absorb blood on contact rather than a separate blood
            refueling process.
        </p>
        <h1>Piercer Revolver</h1>
        <br>
        <img class="weps" src="./img/Piercer.jpeg" alt="">
        <p>The Piercer Revolver is the first gun found in ULTRAKILL and is the blue variant of the Revolver, it can deal
            moderate amounts of damage with its primary fire and can pierce through multiple targets with its secondary
            fire.</p>
        <br>
        <h1>Marksman Revolver</h1>
        <br>
        <img class="weps" src="./img/Marksman.jpeg" alt="">
        <p>The Marksman Revolver appears almost identical to the Piercer Revolver, but has neon green lights as well as
            a different interface that indicates the amount of available coins.
            The primary fire is identical to the Piercer revolver, but the secondary fire makes V1 toss a coin into the
            air, which when shot at, hitscans projectiles will bereflected onto enemies weapoints
        </p>
        <br>
        <h1>Alternate Revolver</h1>
        <br>
        <img class="alt" src="./guns/Alt_Marksman.jpeg" alt="">
        <img class="alt" src="./guns/Alt_Piercer..webp" alt="">
        <br>
        <p>The alternate Revolvers can be unlocked after interacting with all four secret slabs found all throughout
            Limbo.
            It dies significantly more damage than the default variants of the revolvers, but it has a slower fire-rate.
        </p>
        <h1>Core Eject Shotgun</h1>
        <br>
        <img class="weps" src="./img/Core_Shotgun.jpeg" alt="">
        <p>The Core Eject Shotgun appears to be a futuristic double-barrel break-action shotgun. 2 cylindrical cores can
            be found in the chamber, which is flipped open to vent the overheated cores on primary fire and ejected as a
            single projectile on secondary fire, which turns the cores into an explosive projectile. After firing a
            core, the 2 cores will be discarded and replaced.</p>
        <br>
        <h1>Pump Charge Shotgun</h1>
        <br>
        <img class="weps" src="./img/Pump_Shotgun.jpeg" alt="">
        <p>The Pump Charge variant of the shotgun functions very similarly to the Core Eject variant, the only
            difference being that you can "pump" the shotgun 2 times for additional pelletes, however, if you pump 3
            times, it causes the gun to "overpump", which makes the shotgun explode when fired, causing a lot of damage
            to enemies, but also to the player</p>
        <h1>Attractor Nailgun</h1>
        <br>
        <img class="weps" src="./img/Attractor_Nailgun.jpeg" alt="">
        <p>The Attractor Nailgun is a bulky, double-barreled weapon that resembles a minigun. Holding primary fire will
            cause the Attractor Nailgun to start firing nails at a rapid rate, and pressing alt fire will launch an nail
            magnet that attracts the fired nails. Centered on the weapon is a neon blue interface that indicates ammo
            count and the amount of available nail magnets.</p>
        <br>
        <h1>Overheat Nailgun</h1>
        <br>
        <img class="weps" src="./img/Overheat_Nailgun.jpeg" alt="">
        <p>The Overheat Nailgun functions very similarly to the Attractor variant, the difference being it can fire
            indefinetly, at the cost of slowly reducing it's fire rate and chargin one of the batteries, however, the
            secondary fire causes the nailgun to "overheat", consuming one of the battery charges and spewing tons of
            fiery nails. </p>
        <h1>Charged Electric Railcannon</h1>
        <br>
        <img class="weps" src="./img/ChargedERail.jpeg" alt="">
        <p>The Electric Railcannon is a large blue and silver gun that, as its name suggests, resembles a hybrid between
            a railgun and a cannon. Pressing primary fire will instantly fire a piercing hitscan beam, which can pierce
            through an infinite amount of enemies and deal 8 damage on each hit .</p>
        <br>
        <h1>Charged Screwdriver Railcannon</h1>
        <br>
        <img class="weps" src="./img/ChargedSRail.jpeg" alt="">
        <p>The Screwdriver railcannon functions very differently than it's default variant, instead of a burst damage
            piercing hitscan beam, it fires a high-velocity screwdriver that sticks into enemies, and constantly damages
            them for 8 seconds, providing and infinite source of healing and doing 1 damage for 8 seconds on a single
            target.</p>
        <h1>Malicious Railcannon</h1>
        <br>
        <img class="weps" src="./img/ChargedMRail.jpeg" alt="">
        <p>The Malicious Railcannon, as it's name suggests, functions very diffirently than the default variant, it
            launches an hitscan beam that will produce a large explosion on impact, nearly identical to the Malicious
            Face enemy, being very useful for clearing enemy hordes. </p>
        <h1>Feedbacker</h1>
        <br>
        <img class="weps" src="./img/Feedbacker_on_TranspBG.jpeg" alt="">
        <p>The feedbacker is v1's default arm, The key feature of the Feedbacker is its ability to parry. With precise
            timing, punching almost any projectile in the game will boost its speed, and send it flying in the direction
            of the player's crosshair. In addition, physically punching an enemy during their parry window will cause a
            parry punch, punching them for 5 damage and (usually) cancelling their attack.</p>
        <br>
        <h1>KnuckleBlaster</h1>
        <br>
        <img class="weps" src="./img/Knuckleblaster_on_TransparentBG.jpeg" alt="">
        <p>The KnuckleBlaster is an alternative to V1's default arm, punching with this arm will deal heavy damage and
            send enemies flying away, but cannot parry.</p>
        <h1>Whiplash</h1>
        <br>
        <img class="weps" src="./img/Greenarmextended.jpeg" alt="">
        <p>Unlike the Feedbacker or Knuckleblaster, you cannot switch to the Whiplash; instead, it is automatically used
            by pressing its dedicated hotkey (R by default), which will pull you to big enemies and grapple points and
            bring small enemies to you. You can also dash while in the process of pulling/being pulled by an object.</p>
